\section*{\underline{Purpose}}
What sets me apart from the rest of these Chumps, is my upmost loyalty and constant devotion to our noble cause.
In recent times as the pandemic has stricken the UK of many of it's vital services such as healthcare. We often find shady characters prowling on
employment websites, mind you, not looking to contribute but to fill their greedy pockets with the tax-payers hard earned cash. I wish to experience the world through helping others and through
taste.
